Ownership in Rust (Core Concept)
Ownership is Rust’s memory management model. Unlike languages with garbage collection (GC) (like Python or Java) or manual memory management (like C/C++), Rust enforces ownership rules at compile time to prevent memory leaks and data races.

Ownership ensures: ✅ Memory safety without a garbage collector
✅ Prevention of data races in multithreading
✅ Efficient memory allocation and deallocation

1. Ownership Rules
Rust enforces three rules for ownership:

1️⃣ Each value in Rust has a single owner
2️⃣ When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates memory
3️⃣ You can transfer ownership but cannot have multiple mutable owners

❌ Rules for Mutable Borrowing:

You can’t have multiple mutable references at the same time (prevents data races).
You can’t mix mutable and immutable references.
✔ Enforces safe concurrency without runtime checks.

Summary
✅ Ownership ensures memory safety without a garbage collector
✅ Values have a single owner, and Rust automatically deallocates them
✅ Moves (instead of copying) prevent double-free errors
✅ Borrowing allows functions to access data without ownership transfer
✅ Mutable references ensure controlled modifications

Ownership is what makes Rust safe and efficient without needing a garbage collector. 🚀
